I think the problem I’m having with my SUDOKUBE navigation, is that in my first attempts to move around the KUBE, and to keep the distance from the nearest visible layer to the camera at a constant were done by moving the camera around the KUBE, and nearer and further from the KUBE.  This is now a problem because I subsequently decided that it make more sense to move the SudoCenter and have the camera follow that around (which would happen automatically because the Camera is a Child of the SudoCenter.

This (probably) wouldn’t be a problem, but I did a lot of cutting & pasting when I made the change, so I have re-used a lot of code that tweaks the Camera position.  So now I think I’m moving both the SudoCenter and the Camera (unintentionally).  This need to be investigated, and maybe the ShowHideLayer module needs to be rewritten from scratch.
